This is a documentation for git workflow. It will help new git users level up on git commands and workflow.

Git workflow is key for every developer in a distributed team. I have created a simple document to help us grasp some of these workflows.

This can be found in the link `here (http://anything-git.readthedocs.io/en/develop/git_workflow.html)`

Gain some simple yet useful concepts that will help you get up to task with git.

Some of the popular git commands and how to use them.

My key encouragement is grow! grow! grow! There is much to learn.


Contributions are highly welcome lets make this document as robust as possible and help other developers grow. It is the simple things we do to others that really matter.
